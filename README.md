# Checkbox 3 states plugin

This plugin allows you to have a third state on the checkboxes of the task list.
Works on mobile, but you have to adjust the value manualy, set `/`.

## How to use.

Do a [SHIFT]+[CLICK] on a checkbox to set this third state (not fully done).

## How to customize colors

Open **Obisdian settings**, in the `Community plugins` list choose **Checkbox 3 states**.

In this panel, set the two colors:

-   `Base color`, the color of the checkbox in this third state.
-   `Hover color`, the color of the checkbox in this third state when it is hovered with the mouse.

## Informations

It adds a `/` instead of an `x` as value. On mobile, you have to adjust the value by hand (shift is not accessible).
